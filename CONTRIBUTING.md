# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Adhering to these guidelines ensures a smooth review process and maintains code quality.

## 1. Reporting Issues

- **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug, please search existing issues first. If it is new, open a new issue describing the bug, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots or log files if available.
- **Feature Requests**: Open an issue describing the feature, why it is needed, and any proposed visual or architectural implementations.

_Note: For security vulnerabilities, please refer to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and do not file a public issue._

## 2. Development Setup

We recommend using the standard package manager defined in the repository.

1. Clone your fork of the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server and test suite locally to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   pnpm run test
   ```

## 3. Creating a Branch

Before writing code, create a branch off the `main` branch with a descriptive prefix:

```bash
# For a new feature:
git checkout -b feature/dynamic-header

# For a bug fix:
git checkout -b fix/issue-123-grid-overlap

# For documentation or refactoring:
git checkout -b chore/clean-unused-imports
```

## 4. Coding Standards

- All contributions must follow the protocols in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- Verify UI updates against the visual guidelines in [DESIGN-SYSTEM.md](DESIGN-SYSTEM.md).
- Write or update unit tests for any logic you implement or modify.
- Run code formatting and linting scripts locally before pushing:
  ```bash
  pnpm run lint
  pnpm run format
  ```

## 5. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Sync your fork with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-branch-name
   git rebase main
   ```
2. Push your changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
3. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
4. Ensure your PR description clearly states:
   - What changes are introduced.
   - Which issues are resolved (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Visual comparisons (before/after screenshots) for UI modifications.
